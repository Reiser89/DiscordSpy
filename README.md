# DiscordSpy
A client for bots.
It is in very early developement.

## How to use?
* Clone or download as zip-file. And save/unzip it somewhere on your computer.
* Open the folder for your platform and execute the binary file.
* Put your bot-token into the fild on top left and click connect.
... Usability is similar to the Discord Client.

## Warning
**User-Accounts: Discord doesn't allow other clients then their own for unknown reason. Using tokens from normal user accounts can get you banned from Discord and is not recommended.**
Bot-Accounts are fine.
